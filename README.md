A possible solution to integrate c/c++ legacy code and rust code all together under python bindings: [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/). Also check [wasmer-python](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python) for bindings.

Current stage:
**exp**: Experimental test and learning.

Next state:
**dev**: Compile code to wasmer and do development.
